pypoker-core is a basic set of python routines that implement card
decks and poker hands.

Decks contain Cards, which can be used to create Hands.  PokerHands
can be evaluated to string names, and can also be evaluated to
canonical values, which are integers constructed so that for any two
hands, if one hand has a higher canonical value than the other, that
hand wins in the conventional poker ranking.  If the two hands tie,
the canonical values will be equivalent.
